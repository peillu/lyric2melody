# Lyric to Melody Generator

A song is a music composition intended to be performed by the human voice (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song). In popular music, a song always contains contain a melody track for vocal part, and mutiple accompaniment tracks for instrumental/vocal accompaniment.

Given lyrics, composers produce melodies and arrangements, which is one of the most common ways for musicians to compose a song. In this way, composers need to consider the relationship between lyrics and melodies.

This project is to generate a song with given lyrics, which consider the relationship between lyrics and songs in structure, prosody and semantic meanings. The final vocal line is synthesized by our virtual singers. It has the following features:
- We support both Chinese and English lyrics in traditional poems.
- For Chinese lyrics, we support switching tunes templates for the same lyric title.
- For Chinese lyrics, we support switching lyrics for the same tunes template.
- We support choosing different accompaniment styles.
- The speed of song generation is fast in that a song can be generated less than 30s.
- To the best of our knowledge, this is the first product to realize lyric to song generation in real time, comparing with previous work that either can only generate short music segments or can only generate instrumental tracks without lead voice.

## Lyrics Set

We provide samples from Chinese and English lyrics separately as reference.

### Chinese lyrics

Here is the example of a song generated by given Chinese lyrics.

We give the lyrics below:
````
滚滚长江东逝水，浪花淘尽英雄。
是非成败转头空，青山依旧在，几度夕阳红。
白发渔樵江渚上，惯看秋月春风。
一壶浊酒喜相逢，古今多少事，都付笑谈中。
一壶浊酒喜相逢，古今多少事，都付笑谈中。
````

Then the melody is generated as:

### English lyrics
````
Here is the example of a song generated by given English lyrics.
Shall I com-pare,thee to a sum,-mer's day?
Thou art more love,-ly and more tem,-per-ate.
Rough winds do shake,the dar-ling buds,of May,
And sum-mer's lease,hath all too short,a date.
Some-time too hot,the eye of hea,-ven shines,
And of-ten is,his gold com-ple,-xion dimmed;
And ev-ery fair,from fair some-time,dec-lines,
By chance or na,-ture's chan-ging course,un-trimmed.
But thy e-ter,-nal sum-mer shall,not fade,
Nor lose pos-ses,-sion of that fair,thou ow'st,
Nor shall Death brag,thou wand-'rest in,his shade,
When in e-ter,-nal lines to time,thou grow'st.
So long as men,can breathe or eyes,can see,
So long lives this,and this gives life,to thee.
````
